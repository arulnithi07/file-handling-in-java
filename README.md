         ðŸ“Œ Features Demonstrated
         
 File Writing using FileWriter

 File Reading using FileReader and BufferedReader

  Appending Content using FileWriter in append mode

Exception Handling for robust file operations

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:

âœ… To understand and implement file input/output (I/O) operations in Java.

âœ… To create a reusable utility that can write to, read from, and append to text files.

âœ… To demonstrate usage of Javaâ€™s FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, and BufferedWriter classes.

âœ… To develop error-handling skills by managing exceptions during file operations.


ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The Java File Utility project is a console-based Java application that demonstrates the core concepts of file handling using standard Java I/O classes. The project enables users to create, read, write, and modify text files through simple and intuitive operations.

This utility showcases how Java can interact with the file system to perform essential operations, making it a fundamental building block for real-world software development tasks such as data storage, logging, configuration management, and file-based applications.

This project was developed as part of the CODTECH Internship Program to apply theoretical concepts in a practical file handling scenario.



âœ… To reinforce basic console-based interaction using the Scanner class for user input.
